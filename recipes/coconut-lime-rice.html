		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="body-text">
			Lime flavor compliments this coconut rice very well, so I highly recommend
			mixing 1 to 2 tablespoons of lime juice to the rice to brighten everything
			up. You can infuse even more lime flavor by adding the zest of 1 lime into
			the rice. Add it before you start cooking the rice or after the rice is
			cooked. Note that if you cook the rice with the lime zest, the rice will
			pick up a faint green hue.
		</p>
		<p class="body-text">
			Once you turn off the heat for the rice, let it rest in the saucepan,
			covered. Because we're cooking the rice for only about 8 to 9 minutes, we
			need the residual steam in the saucepan to finish the cooking process.
			That's why it's crucial to leave the lid on.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul class="body-text">
			<li>1 cup jasmine or basmati rice</li>
			<li>1/3 cup full-fat coconut milk</li>
			<li>1 cup water</li>
			<li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
			<li>1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol class="body-text">
			<li>
				Rinse the rice several times and transfer it to a saucepan. Add the
				coconut milk, water, and salt and give everything a stir.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring everything to boil, uncovered. Reduce the heat to low, cover the
				saucepan and cook for 8 to 9 minutes, until the water has been absorbed
				by the rice. I usually transfer the saucepan to a burner with a smaller
				flame so that the liquids don't absorb too quickly. Turn off the heat
				and let the rice sit on the stove for 10 to 12 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Uncover the saucepan. You'll notice a layer of coconut cream at the top
				of the rice, and that's perfectly normal. Fluff the rice with a fork and
				stir to distribute the coconut cream. Add the lime juice to the rice and
				stir again. Taste the rice and add more lime juice, if necessary. Serve
				the rice with your favorite dish.
			</li>
